# Welcome to Write.MD

Inspired by the [P.D. Workman's blog post](https://pdworkman.com/writing-a-novel-in-markdown/) and means to be a quick staring spot for a new vault to get any authors either new to the craft, like myself; those moving to Obsidian; or authors who are well versed with this and just want to get their next writing project off of the ground.  

There have not been any customization and does not require any specialized community plugins installed.  However, I would ***highly*** suggest to take some time and go and look at the plethora of highly useful and some down right important community plugins in the Obsidian.MD ecosystem. 

## Requirements
While there are not any community plugins, there are several built in plugins which are required for this to work: Please check the table below:
